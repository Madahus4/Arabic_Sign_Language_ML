## Abstract
Sign language encompasses the movement of the arms and hands as a means of communication
for people with hearing disabilities.
And Since sign languages are many and different, we will focus on Arabic alphabets,
Therefore, in this project we aim to analyze the alphabets of Arabic Sign Language using deep learning models.

## Problem statement
Given a various alphabets along with images dataset pertaining to that alphabets, we are challenged to predict each alphabet in each image if and only if it contain one.

## Data
The datase that will be used in this project has been downloaded from [Mendely Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/y7pckrw6z2/1) , consists of **54,049 images** of ArASL alphabets performed by more than 40 people for 32 standard Arabic signs and alphabets. separated in **32 folders** which represent the various classes. **28** are for the letters **Alif - Yaa** and **4** classes for **Laa(لا), AL (ال),Taa(ة) and Ya(ئ)**. And The number of images per class differs from one class to another
